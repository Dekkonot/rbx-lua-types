# RBX-Lua-Types

This project is meant to provide a consistent representation of Roblox's data types for things like a DOM... in pure Lua. It is **not** meant to implement the entirety of Roblox's API. That task is monumental and well outside scope.

This project contains an 'Instance' type that can be used as a representation for Roblox classes. No validation is done on members pushed or popped onto these classes, including the ClassName.
